# Hacker News App
Hacker News app using Vanilla PHP, Guzzle and Carbon

Hacker News released its API to the world. Developers used to rely on web scraping and paginated results to obtain data from the Hacker News site, but everything has changed now. With Hacker News’ API, we have a structured way to tap into the data. 

I’ve worked about the API a little bit and created a Hacker News app using Vanilla PHP, Carbon and Guzzle. 
Guzzle is a HTTP client for consuming APIs.
